# Skill: Red Bean Design System

## Context & Execution Model
Read and apply this skill whenever a frontend file (`.tsx`, `.ts`, `.css`) is created, modified, or refactored. This file is the single description of "The Red Bean Scheduler" visual language: the design tokens that exist, the real page/component structures that exist today, and the rules for extending them consistently. Previous versions of this file described aspirational layouts (hero sections, search-anchor navbars, hamburger menus) that were never built — this version only documents what is actually in the codebase, so it stays trustworthy as a reference.

## 1. Design Tokens (single source of truth)

All brand and semantic colors are declared once, in `src/app/globals.css`, inside the Tailwind v4 `@theme` block. **Never** hardcode raw Tailwind palette classes (`bg-stone-50`, `text-red-900`, `bg-amber-100`, etc.) in a component — use the semantic token below instead. This is what gives the app global theming and a shared vocabulary: change a hex value once in `globals.css` and every page updates.

There is no `tailwind.config.js` — Tailwind v4 reads tokens from CSS, and a stale v3-style config file with a different, unused color set used to sit alongside `globals.css`. It has been deleted. `globals.css` is the only place colors are defined.

### Brand
| Token | Hex | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `brand` | `#7f1d1d` | Primary actions, links, active tab state, brand text |
| `brand-deep` | `#450a0a` | Headings on brand, gradient end, hover states, brand-as-alert (error banners reuse this — see Note below) |
| `coffee` | `#6f4e37` | Secondary brand accent (rarely used directly; prefer `ink-*` for text) |
| `cream` | `#f5e6d3` | Warm secondary surface |
| `cream-white` | `#fff8f0` | Text/labels placed on top of a brand-colored button or surface |

### Neutral (light chrome — login, availability, dashboard main panel, capacity page)
| Token | Maps to | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `surface` | stone-50 | Page background |
| `surface-muted` | stone-100 | Cards-on-cards, toggle tracks, table header rows |
| `border` | stone-200 | Default hairline border/divider |
| `border-strong` | stone-300 | Hover/emphasized border, unselected glyph color |
| `ink` | stone-800 | Headings, primary text |
| `ink-soft` | stone-700 | Labels, sub-headings, secondary buttons |
| `ink-muted` | stone-500 | Help text, metadata |
| `ink-faint` | stone-400 | Placeholder text, least-important meta |

### Dark chrome (admin dashboard sidebar only)
| Token | Maps to |
|---|---|
| `surface-dark` | stone-900 |
| `border-dark` | stone-800 |
| `ink-on-dark` | stone-100 |
| `ink-on-dark-muted` | stone-400 |

### Status
| Token | Hex | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `success` | `#15803d` | Approved badges, success banners |
| `warning` | `#78350f` | Deadline notices, pending badges, holiday-mode banners |
| `danger` | `#881337` | Under-scheduled / compliance-violation badges |
| `caution` | `#7c2d12` | Over-scheduled badges |

### Schedule shift-type accents
Used to colour-code the weekly roster and shift pickers by shift block, for a cleaner multi-colour schedule (Employee_scheduling reference) anchored by the brand crimson.
| Token | Hex | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `shift-morning` | `#c2410c` | Opening shift (honey orange) |
| `shift-afternoon` | `#0f766e` | Midday shift (teal) |
| `shift-evening` | `#9f1239` | Closing shift (rose-crimson) |
| `shift-morning-soft` / `shift-afternoon-soft` / `shift-evening-soft` | tints | Soft cell/chip fills behind the matching accent text |

These three drive: the admin `RosterGrid` filled cells + gutter, the employee `ShiftSelector` selected buttons, and the gradient page headings (`bg-clip-text`). Stat-card and heading gradients combine them with `brand` (e.g. `from-brand via-shift-evening to-shift-morning`).

**Note on error banners:** form-level errors (login, availability) intentionally reuse `brand`/`brand-deep` rather than `danger`. This is a deliberate brand choice already baked into every page — the crimson *is* the alert color here, not a separate red. `danger`/`caution` are reserved for the roster compliance badges in `RosterGrid`, which need to stay visually distinct from "this is brand crimson" so admins can tell a real scheduling violation apart from ordinary brand chrome.

Opacity modifiers work normally on any token: `bg-brand-deep/5`, `border-success/15`, `text-ink-muted` etc.

## 2. Real Page & Component Structures

### Portal splash (`src/app/page.tsx`)
Full-screen brand gradient (`bg-linear-to-br from-brand-deep to-brand`) with a low-opacity cream radial glow. Centered bean mark in a translucent `bg-cream-white/10` tile, "The Red Bean" title in `cream-white`, and a pulsing loader bar. Error state swaps in an X glyph and a `bg-cream-white` "Go to Login" button. This is the only crimson-flooded page besides the login brand panel; all text uses `cream-white`/`cream` for contrast.

### Login (`src/app/login/page.tsx`)
**Split-panel** (SaleSkip-inspired). On `lg+`: a left brand `<aside>` (`w-1/2`, `bg-linear-to-br from-brand-deep via-brand to-brand-deep`, decorative concentric `cream-white/10` rings) holding the logo, a "Welcome to The Red Bean 👋" headline, a short pitch, a 3-item feature checklist, and a copyright line — all in `cream`/`cream-white`. The right `w-1/2` panel is a clean `surface` column holding the form. Below `lg`, the brand panel is hidden and a compact centered bean mark (`lg:hidden`) sits above the form instead. Form internals are unchanged: segmented Sign In/Sign Up toggle, stacked fields, gradient brand CTA, divider, Google OAuth button, footer links. Error/success banners reuse `brand`/`success` at low opacity.

### Availability (`src/app/availability/page.tsx`)
Sticky header (avatar/initials, email, week label, Sign Out button) over a `max-w-5xl` column: deadline notice banner (`brand` if passed, `warning` if upcoming) → **two-column `lg:grid-cols-2` split** (stacks on mobile). **Left card — "Weekly Requirements":** 3 big requirement rows (Shifts Selected / Hours / Status), each a `flex items-center` tile with a 56px (`h-14 w-14`) icon circle, a `text-4xl font-extrabold` value, and a `✓` mark once met (`bg-success/10` tile background); below that, "The Rules" — the old plain bullet list reworked into `text-base font-medium` rows each with a small brand-tinted circular checkmark, matching the login page's feature-checklist treatment rather than a flat `<ul>`. **Right card — "Pick Your Shifts":** `ShiftSelector` + the Save button. Avatar uploader sits full-width below both columns.

### ShiftSelector (`src/components/modules/ShiftSelector.tsx`)
One `<section>` per day, each rendering 3 shift-type buttons (morning/afternoon/evening) in a `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3`. Selected state is **colour-coded by shift type** to match the admin roster legend (`border-2 border-shift-* bg-shift-*-soft text-shift-*` + a matching `text-shift-*` checkmark). Unselected: `border-border text-ink-soft`.

### Admin Dashboard (`src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`)
Two-pane layout: a fixed dark sidebar (`w-72`, `surface-dark`/`border-dark`/`ink-on-dark*` tokens — the only place dark chrome is used), deliberately roomy rather than compact — `text-base font-semibold` nav rows (`py-3.5`), a `text-lg font-bold` brand wordmark, and `text-base` Publish/Sign Out buttons — with an icon **nav** (Roster Dashboard [active] + a `next/link` to Capacity Settings), week summary, Publish button, Sign Out button. The gradient heading (`bg-clip-text`) sits above a **4-up stats overview row** — Submissions / Pending Review / Approved / Coverage — each a **gradient hero tile** (centered, white text on `bg-linear-to-br` gradients: brand / shift-morning / success / shift-afternoon), with a white-circle icon and a decorative corner glow. `RosterGrid` renders beneath it. **Note:** all gradient/accent classes are written as full static strings (`from-success to-[#166534]`), never interpolated (`from-${x}`) — Tailwind's JIT only sees complete class literals.

### RosterGrid (`src/components/modules/RosterGrid.tsx`)
Opens with a **shift colour legend** (morning/afternoon/evening dots). Then a **Shift Staffing Summary** built from large, clickable, colour-coded bubbles: for each day, a `grid-cols-3` row of big gradient tiles (`SHIFT_SUMMARY_GRADIENT` — same per-shift-type gradients as the dashboard hero stats: morning/afternoon/evening), each showing `actual/required` in a `text-4xl font-extrabold`, with a `danger` shortfall badge in the corner when understaffed. Clicking a bubble toggles `scale-[1.06] shadow-2xl ring-4 ring-cream-white/70` and expands a panel beneath that day listing every approved employee on that shift (`AvatarDisplay` + email + truncated profile ID), built from a `shiftAssignments[day][shift]` map derived alongside the existing staffing counts — selection state is local (`useState<{ day, shift } | null>`), one bubble at a time. Below the summary: Pending/Approved sections of per-employee cards. Each card: avatar + email header with status pill (`success`/`warning`) and compliance badge (`danger`/`caution`), then a day×shift matrix with a left **shift-label gutter** tinted by shift type (`shift-*-soft` bg + `shift-*` text) and day-column headers; filled cells are solid colour blocks **per shift type** (`bg-shift-morning/afternoon/evening text-cream-white`), empty cells a faint `text-border-strong` dash. Footer has shift/hour metrics and an Approve/Revert action.

### Admin Capacity (`src/app/admin/capacity/page.tsx`)
`max-w-4xl` settings page: holiday-override toggle, one card per day with 3 numeric capacity inputs, summary card, Save/Reset/Back actions.

## 3. Guardrails: Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
* Reach for a semantic token (`brand`, `ink`, `surface`, `success`, etc.) before reaching for a raw Tailwind palette class. If the color you need doesn't have a token yet, add one to `globals.css` rather than hardcoding a one-off hex/palette class.
* Apply subtle touch-scaling effects (`active:scale-[0.98]`) to tactile interactive states.
* Keep borders soft, micro-thin, and slightly translucent (`border-border/60`).
* Use the dark-chrome tokens (`surface-dark`, etc.) only for the admin sidebar — it's the one intentionally dark surface in the app; every other page is light.

### Don't:
* Do not introduce a second color system (this app already paid down a real bug from having two: a dead `tailwind.config.js` palette and an unused `globals.css` palette, neither of which any page actually used).
* Do not introduce harsh, solid black outline wrappers, drop shadows with deep opacities, or harsh sharp 0px corners.
* Do not use default gray palettes (`bg-slate-50`, `text-gray-400`); always use the warm `ink-*`/`surface-*` tokens instead.
* Do not write or include automated UI layout/pixel tests unless explicitly instructed.
